## Progress

Stage 1: Planning

I was provided an example criteria for layout purposes. In google slides I did a rough draft of it to ease the process when it comes to html and css.

Stage 2: Basic html framework

Sectioning off each area based off the layout above, this will make the css so much easier when it's time to flex!

Stage 3: Content

A challenging part for me is filling in the content, I am currently a week into my coding bootcamp so I don't have a lot of projects. I'll use fillers to start. 

Tested the using image as a link, worked great! (probably should be focusing on filling out the content though)
