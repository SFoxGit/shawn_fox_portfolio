            <p>
                I have nearly 18 years working experience in just about everything except coding. So what drew me to
                want to
                learn to code? Coding seemed so fascinating to me, it was
                largely logic based problem solving (which I love) and you could see a tangible result from your work.
                Working in sales I wasn't able to point to something and say "That's
                what all my hard work went into today." The barrier for entry into software engineering or web
                developement
                seems non existant so I decided to chase something I can be passionate
                about. I knew this wasn't going to be easy, but I knew if I put my all into it then I would be
                successful.
                There is an old mindset that dates back millennia, if you want to
                conquer a hostile place you burn your boats upon landing. There is no retreat, you conquer or you
                perish. I
                committed to learning to code, I am past the point of no return. I will
                conquer because I will not allow myself to perish. Take a look below at my conquests so far and lets
                figure
                out what WE can conquer together.
