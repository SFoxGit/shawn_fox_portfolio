        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I have nearly 18 years working experience in just about everything except coding. So what drew me to want to
            learn to code? Coding seemed so fascinating to me, it was
            largely logic based problem solving (which I love) and you could see a tangible result from your work.
            Working in sales I wasn't able to point to something and say "That's
            what all my hard work went into today." The barrier for entry into software engineering or web developement
            seems non existant so I decided to chase something I can be passionate
            about. I knew this wasn't going to be easy, but I knew if I put my all into it then I would be successful.
            There is an old mindset that dates back millennia, if you want to
            conquer a hostile place you burn your boats upon landing. There is no retreat, you conquer or you perish. I
            committed to learning to code, I am past the point of no return. I will
            conquer because I will not allow myself to perish. Take a look below at my conquests so far and lets figure
            out what WE can conquer together.
